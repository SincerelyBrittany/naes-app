              eat anything healthy? Well, let me introduce you to a little girl
              named Felicia.Â  Felicia loves sweets and frowns upon foods that
              are good for her, including oatmeal! Finicky Felicia is a book
              about how she is surprised to taste vegetables while learning how
              important it is to eat vegetables. Read more to learn how Finicky
              Felicia became less finicky!
